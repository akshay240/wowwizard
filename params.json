{"name":"WowWizard","tagline":"WowWizard, a form wizard for your taste!","body":"#### What is WowWizard?\r\nWowWizard is a jQuery plugin that is designed for developers seeking an awesome & multi-purpose form wizard. \r\nI needed to write a interactive form that is not just made up from inputs, but instead giving people a better experience so WowWizard is made.\r\n## Getting Started\r\nA simple WowWizard plugin usage is as below. Plugin is simply being injected into the element you specify(`<div class=\"wow-wizard\">` in this case).\r\n```\r\n$('.wow-wizard').wowWizard({\r\n    theme: 'pomegranate',\r\n    nextButtonText: 'Next',\r\n    loader: '../../img/loader.gif',\r\n    steps: [\r\n        {...},\r\n        {...}\r\n    ]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n* **theme:** Custom theme to use in the plugin. For now, we only have \"pomegranate\" template.\r\n* **nextButtonText:** Text that is going to be seen in \"Next\" button.\r\n* **loader:** If you don't want to use the default loader, you can specify another one here. \r\n* **steps:** Steps array. Basically keeps your steps. Step types & options will be mentioned below.\r\n\r\n### Step Types\r\nEvery step has some common options and some step-spesific options. Options that exist in every step:\r\n* **name:** Name of the step. You will get the data related to this step with this key.\r\n* **type:** Specifying the type of the step. Step types will be mentioned below.\r\n* **indicatorName:** Name that is going to be seen in as step name in the indicator box.\r\n* **questionTitle:** Title of the step question.\r\n* **questionDescription:** Description of the step question(Optional).\r\n\r\n#### single_choice:\r\nUser select only one choice from the given inputs. \r\n```\r\n{\r\n\tname: 'estate_type',\r\n\ttype: 'single_choice',\r\n\tindicatorName: 'Estate Status',\r\n\tquestionTitle: 'You are buying an estate for sure. For rent or for sale?',\r\n\tquestionDescription: 'Answer me!',\r\n\tanswers: [\r\n\t    {\r\n\t        value: 'for_rent',\r\n\t        text: 'For Rent'\r\n\t    },\r\n\t    {\r\n\t        value: 'for_sale',\r\n\t        text: 'For Sale'  \r\n\t    }\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```","google":"UA-58260636-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
